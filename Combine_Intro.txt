The idea is as follows.
The Hazardous Enviroments soundtrack is an amazing and very under-used and under-utilized one,
My suggestion is for it to be used in a start-up sequence for Transhuman Soldiers as well as adding a quite lengthy start-up sequence, This is both ways good to keep
players from rapid switching to TA upon JWs as well as having a fun and amazing start-up sequence with Hazardous Enviroments playing as the system and suit powers up 
The transhuman soldier.
Now this can either be an optional setting set on default or a first time introduction sequence for new TA players.

If it feels weird the gordon freeman HEV suit music is playing its really meant for the song being used in a scientific nature if anything though any other song from 
the HL2 soundtrack may be used instead.
Overall I believe everyone would like this and feel incredible when hopping on TA and hearing the awesome Hazardous Enviroments track.
